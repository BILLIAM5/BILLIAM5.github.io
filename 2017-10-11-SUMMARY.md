**SUMMARY OF THE IT CODING**

So far in IT this year we have learnt how to encode different words and phrases using Caesar Cipher to make a message coded using the key that we have created and it can be decoded by anyone who has the right key.

To decode the coded message you need the key and then you use the =vlookup() to make it easy to encode but you have to type out all of the alphabet and all of the coded alphabet which is a bit of a pain but at the end of the day I think that it's worth it.

The annoying thing about it all is that if you mess it up then you have to do it all over again and that would be the most annoying thing ever to happen to you. Trust me on that because it happened to me.

We also did the coding with binary and that was even harder because we had to work out all of the numbers from 1 to 26 to get the whole alphabet. But we just looked it up because we're lazy.

We started off with the simple statement that was HELLO WORLD and used that to encode and then decode after. Then we got our own key and our own messages and we did it from there.

For example, my key was CHORLEYWOOD and so the message would have gone from:

HELLO WORLD

To:

WLCCF NFICR

So, that is the summary of IT from coding in Google Spreadsheets using Caesar Cipher and now we know all the shortcuts and so do you.
