**BINARY CODING**               *16/12/2015*

In the lesson today, we learnt about Binary coding. There is a rule in Binary that Mr Keen told us which is to understand Binary and get it correct, all you need to know is the first three numbers. They are, 0=0, 1=1, 2=10, 3=11, 4=100, 5=101, 6=110, 7=111, 8=1000 and so on. In Binary, there are only two numbers, 0&1 and when it gets to two-digit, three-digit and more it isn't ten or one hundred, it?s one-zero for ten and one-zero-zero for one hundred. If you were to add a sum in Binary it would be like this:

**   100101**

**+ 001011**

**   110000**

**        1   1   1   1**

It would look like this because in Binary(as mentioned above)there are only two numbers in Binary, 0&1.
