Sorting Hat Coding

In today's lesson, we built a sorting hat on Touch Develop which included all the houses at DCGS. I learnt that with the different types of blocks we could use we could make anything that we could think of that could include those blocks. It was a fun experience and was able to vary from one house to another at the press of a button.
