    <td>We started by gathering around the front where Mr Keen went on about his experience at McDonalds and then we progressed into looking at how to create different functions on our blogs like adding in tables to show out the outline more clearly and to see which words or phrases were headings and which were answers of statements. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning was looking around the class and focusing on the people around me instead of my own work. This stopped me from progressing further and must be stopped somehow as I would like to get better at IT but that won't happen if I keep chatting and looking around in a daze. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>As said above I will need to combat this issue by trying to ignore people around me and if they ask me for help then I will refuse them as they will not be learning and if it is continuous then they will become reliant on me to do their blogs for them. Where will that get them in life if they are always helped by people around them?</td>
