Microbit

In today's lesson, we looked at the a little mechanism called a Microbit and looked on the BBC website for Microbits. We looked at a tutorial on how to do different types of programming like Java Coding, Block Editor, Touch Develop and Python. We only looked at Block Editor and Touch Develop but talked about Java and Pyhton. On Block Editor, I wrote out some letters and put a command on when they should be shown so that they would spell my name. Further coding was explored later on in the lesson.
