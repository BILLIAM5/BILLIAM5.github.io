Effects and Consequences of Social Media

In the lesson this week we looked what social media can do to you and what can happen if you are too obsessed with social media and on other websites and web pages.

We got put into groups and were handed a pieces of paper each with something to do with social medi and to put them on a scale of less serious to more serious. The one that everyone thought was the least serious was is someone posted a picture of his cat. This is completely harmless as the cat could be anywhere in the world no one that is a threat could find it or you. On the other end of the spectrum, there was someone posting a picture of them on holiday to everyone and the house being empty. This could lead to burglary or someone camping in the house and waiting for them to get back and possibly murder them (at the worst possible cause).  

Then later in the lesson we looked at a video advertising Twitter and clearly promoting it and saying that with Twitter your life is complete and that you need Twitter (Even if you have no experience with other social medias). The untold story is more vague and it is in the scene where a man is crossing a road on his phone. He could be run over.

We also looked at another video showing that there was one person that didn't have a phone and everyone else did. She was always surrounded by people that were on phones and that they all had lives on their phones and they couldnâ€™t do anything without involving their phones. This is what is happening with people these days.
