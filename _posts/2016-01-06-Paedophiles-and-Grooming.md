Paedophiles, Pornography and Grooming

In the lesson today we talked about Internet safety and how there are lots of different websites and webpages out there and lots of different people in the world. Most of them are good but some of them are very bad and do disgusting and unthinkable things to others. 

Paedophiles

A Paedophile is a person over the age of 18 that is sexually attracted to a pre-pubescent person under the age of 16. The legal age to have sex is 16 and paedophiles aim at people under the age of 16 and violate them.

Rapists

A rapist is a male(always a male because they are the only ones with the proper equipment) over the age of 18 and rapes people under the age of 18. The rapists can be very sneaky in disguising the way they get their targets and don't let anyone come with the target unless they could also be a target for the rapist.

Grooming

Grooming is when a Paedophile gets a target through the internet and is very secretive about what is going on and, like a rapist, they disguise it very well so if you think you might be being groomed, you should tell an adult who is responsible.
