  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by watching the attackers style of play and after he got the ball I would go in for the tackle and try to get the ball out to the midfielders and striker. My dad shouting at me from the sideline helped a little bit, but not massively. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were not getting tackled in as then they would be through on goal which wouldn't have been good. Luckily, had that happened to me, someone would be there to sweep in behind and I would do the same thing if it happened to him. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try harder to get some good passes around and try to make some more solid tackles because then I will be improving as a footballer and we would be improving as a team and would then win more and more games. </td>
