**Java Script Tutorials**

In today's lesson we looked at how to program Micro:bits to do certain things on different commands. We did tutorials on how to do a random dice number generator, how to show different emotions and more. I learnt that there are different functions on the sidebar and that there are lots of different ways to do cerntain things to program the Micro:bit.
