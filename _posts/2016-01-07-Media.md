Media

In today's lesson we looked at different types of media such as social media and can be used to do different things like social media is for communicating with others. 

Social Media

Social Media is a way of keeping in touch with people that you are distant from such as friends and relative that you don't see anymore. You can use forms of Social Media such as Skype, Facetime, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Oovoo and lots of others.

Sub-text

The Sub-text is the hidden/unclear text in an advert that no-one will notice. For example, in the advert we saw today, a monkey drove a taxi(which would never happen) and a man with an open can of Pepsi Max. The monkey was a terrible driver and was all over the road and the man never spilled a drop of his drink. In reality, the man would have spilled alot of his drink.
