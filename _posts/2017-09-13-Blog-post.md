Date:13/9/17                                  What we did: Caesar Cipher

In the lesson today we learnt how to do caesar cipher in google sheets and we encoded and decoded messages using our own made up key. We used =vlookup to make both messages work and then used the same to decode them back into normal words and sentences. It was good as I learnt how to do caesar cipher encryptions and then use it in sheets. The fact that we also learnt how to decode messages as well helped with learning. The things that impeded my learning were mainly getting distracted, as always. Today was good.
