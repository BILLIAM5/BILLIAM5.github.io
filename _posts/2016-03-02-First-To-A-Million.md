First To A Million

First To A Million is a series of videos about a brother and a sister in a competition to get one million views on YouTube. The camera is allegedly you who is viewing the video and at the end of each video there is a question and a choice for the viewers to click and it takes you to the ending that you've chosen. The outcome was that everyone fell out with everyone and you could see how everyone turned out afterwards. The person that made everyone fall out searched for help with people who experienced similar things and also looked at CEOP (Child Exploitation & Online Protection) services. 

CEOP

CEOP is a website to put up anything that you may have found disturbing or have witnessed anything wrong and can say it on CEOP. A worker will see this file it to the police to see if they can help with the problem.
