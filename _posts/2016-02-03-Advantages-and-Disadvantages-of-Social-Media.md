Advantages and Disadvantages of Social Media

There are lots of different types of social media and there are advantages and disadvantages of it.

 

 Advantages

The advantages of social media can be contacting friends or relations via messages, Twitter and Instagram. Also, they can send pictures to one another via Snapchat, Skype, Facebook and Facetime. You don't just have to at send texts or pictures or do a video chat, there are still other ways of communicating through social media like playing a video game on the computer, XBOX or PlayStation and chat to people online. But when doing that, make sure that you are always safe with what you are doing otherwise something bad might happen that may or may not involve you.

Disadvantages

The internet isn't always a safe place as there could be a paedophile or a terrorist behind the screen and wouldn’t even know it. Think of the story of Breck Bednar. He was invited onto a server by his friend and then started talking to the creator, Lewis Daynes. Lewis was grooming Breck and started to make him turn against his friends and family until he had no one else to go to except from Lewis. Eventually, Breck was invited through a lie to go and visit Lewis and travel 30 miles to Surrey. He was told to bring all of his technology and once he got there, Lewis murdered him. This story is extremely sad and is to say that you should never trust someone that you don’t know properly.

Social media can be fun and keep us in touch with our close friends and relations but you should be smart with your decisions and **BE SAFE.   **
