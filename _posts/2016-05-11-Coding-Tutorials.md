Coding Tutorials

In  the lesson today we looked at the different code tutorials we did for homework and checked them with a partner. If our code didn't work properly then we would look back at it and see where we went wrong. I particularly learnt that the mistakes I made were due to using the wrong blocks and incorrectly following the tutorials shown. The improvements to make is to follow the guided tutorial but to also explore with the different variations of blocks.
