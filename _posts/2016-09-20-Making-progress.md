(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions in the book and if there were problems with the codes output then we'd see what we’d done wrong and try to fix it without asking for help but eventually we did and we finally made it work how it should. We didn't really have a strategy because we just followed the book.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning wasn’t any habit, rather getting stuck and giving up too easily and trying and trying to get it right but eventually I gave up so I need to persevere more and try and get there on my own. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and do what I said above and get there on my own as nothing in life is handed to you on a plate and you need to work hard to get there. The same as in IT, if you don’t try to get the right coding then you won’t get the right result from it.</td>
