  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by following the book given out at the start of the lesson and followed the instructions on there. It took some reading and some experimenting but eventually me and my partner got 3 scripts all saying different things on them onto our memory sticks. The effective strategies I used where just to listen and do what it said in the book because that had most of the useful information.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learing were that I kept getting distracted by other people and helping them then actually working on my own work and developing that. Like last week, I still need to majorly work on not getting distracted.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by taking more chances and seeing if they work and if they don't work, seeing what I can do to make them work. If they still don’t work I will revert to the book and if all else fails, I’ll ask for help from my classmates or the teacher as I will learn nothing by constantly asking for a teacher’s help.</td>
