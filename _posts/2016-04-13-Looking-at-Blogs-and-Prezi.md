Looking at Blogs and Prezi

In today's lesson, we looked at our blogs and got in pairs and gave reviews on them. Our reviews were given on a scale sight and at the end we gave our partner three pieces of advice on how to improve thier blogs for the future. After that, we looked at our Prezi presentations that we completed as homework over the Easter holidays and we had a look at one of them. It had lots of information but did have lots of grammar mistakes, some copied and pasted parts and had a layout which wasnâ€™t particularly good or ordered.
