    <td>The way that I learnt was to follow the instructions on the left of the monitor and use those into the python coding which enabled me to progress faster than my counterparts as the advanced about 10% and I advanced 15%. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that limited my learning were people asking me what to do as I had already passed their stages, but I didn't tell them what to do as then they would not be learning and I would be getting into trouble as I was doing their work for them. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the way that I tackle a challenging problem as when I could not do a certain stage, I would use trial and error in an attempt to progress instead of rereading the instructions in further detail which would help me get further. </td>
