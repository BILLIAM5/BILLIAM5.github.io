  <tr>
    <td>I learnt that to create a loop in Fuze, you have to first type 'Cycle' so that it knows that it should create a loop, then type ‘Print’ followed by the words you want your monitor to display and it will print them onto the loop, finally you should type ‘Repeat’ so that it knows to continuously create the loop and never stop until told to.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The habits that limited my learning in the lesson were getting distracted by looking at other people’s work around my and not focus ping on my own as it won’t do itself while I am looking at what other people are doing and just wishing that I could get mine to look like theirs. I must listen to the instructions if I wish to do well and will not need to ask for help unless I have tried absolutely everything to try and solve the problem or task assigned.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson, I will listen to everything assigned and persevere if I am having difficulty with the task. I will try to comprehend the instructions from the book and work my way around the problems. If another is struggling and I am not, I will help them on the path but not give them the direct solution so that they still have to look and work for the answer.</td>
