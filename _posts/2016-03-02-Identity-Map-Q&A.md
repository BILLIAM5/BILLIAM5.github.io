1. **How is it to create your identity map? **To create my identity map was like looking back  at my life and seeing everything that I'd done and everything that I've got.

2. **How did you feel about sharing your map with the rest of the class in this way? **I didn't really feel anything as there was nothing on my map that would make me feel anything. All I really felt was pride in my work.

3. **How did it feel to comment on the identity maps? **It felt like I was being like a teacher and that I could say what I thought about the other people's identity maps.

4. **Did you enjoy this process or would you rather asked questions and directly to the student as we sometimes do during class presentations? **I enjoyed the process we were assigned to do as if I saw a bad identity map that looked like it had no effort put into it, I wouldn't want to offend the person, especially if they were a friend.

5. **How did it feel to get the comments back and read through them? Were there any surprises? **I felt eager to read the comments my classmates had left me and when I'd read them I felt like everyone like it. There was the surprise when I saw 'scruffy' but that may have been due to where I positioned my photos but it was intentional.

6. **How is this process different from commenting on something online when you can't see the person? **The process is different from commenting online is that your username can be seen online and people can report or do something to yourself online whereas writing on paper means that the person that commented is anonymous.

7. **Did your identity map help to create a sense of what you would more of or less of in the future? **It did. The comments said that people had learnt something new about me and that if I knew someone well but they didn't know me well, I could tell them what I put on my map.

8. **Are there any other changes you want to make in the media you use based on this activity? **Not** **really as I am happy with all the media I already use and I can't think of any other media I would or want to use at the moment.

9. **Did these six lessons change how you view social media? If so, how? **The six lessons did change my view on social media as it can be used for good things and bad things. Breck Bednar is an example of how bad social media can be showing that no one can be trusted unless you personally know them.

10. **Did the lessons change how you plan on using social media in the future? If so, how? **The lessons did change how I plan to use social media in the future and now. Being thought about dangers of social media has made me be much more smart to decisions and not fall into peer pressure and do something I may regret. Also I should not comment anything rude or offensive towards others as everyone should be treated the same.
