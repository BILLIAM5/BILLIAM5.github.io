Reality

In the lesson today we looked at reality and fantasy in the TV industry. I will use a situation for both and explain the fantasy and reality of the situation.

**SITUATION: ***You are a boy who serves people drinks at a *

*                      football game and have got to run to serve    *

*                      people no matter how far away.*

**FANTASY: ***You have to serve someone an open coke can  *

*                   they're on the other side of a running mob.*

*                   ***_You run as fast as you can, dodging_**

**_                   everyone and everything and deliver the _**

**_                   in perfect a perfect condition without a _**

**_                  drop spilt._**

**REALITY: ***You have to serve someone an open coke can  *

*                  they're on the other side of a running mob.*

*                  ***_You run as fast as you can, but you bump _**

**_                  bump into a few people on the way, _**

**_                  therefore spilling the drink and denting the _**

**_                 can and arriving and getting a complaint _**

**_                 from the person though he still appreciates_**

**_                 what the boy has done for him._**

That is the difference between fantasy and reality. We tend to think of the fantasy as the thing we want to happen but the reality is the thing that is awaiting us.
