In today's lesson, we encrypted messages. We first had to make up a code to use in the program. I went for a simple code- the Caesar Cipher- so I could get the code right. We were showed how it was done and what code we should put in to make our encrypting machines work.

In the lesson, I learnt a lot of things about google spreadsheets. I thought that it was just used for tables and things like that. I had no idea it had a functions button in it and I had no idea the program had the capability for the user to input code into it.

Next time, I would like to put what I have learnt from today into practice. Now I knew a few things that you can do in spreadsheets, I want to implement that into other things within spreadsheets. When using spreadsheets next time, I will hopefully work faster as I understand how to use it. That is how I will improve myself through spreadsheets.
